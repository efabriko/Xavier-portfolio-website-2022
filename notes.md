#Questions / comments:


##Remove unused CSS
. Done for most of it. For some unused I prefer to keep as I may adjust the CSS later on.


##Group CSS by pages
. Done I think
. Not clear about the @media... Now it is located in the WORK Page Group of CSS Rules however as it is shared by 2 pages (work and contact) maybe it should be in the "SHARED STYLING" at the beginning of the page


##Implement bootstrap on Contact page
. Initially I implemented Bootstrap for the contact form however it modified too much some other part of my code (h1, h2 margin styling in particular) so eventually I decided to use @media query to adjust the width of the form depending on the width of the screen
