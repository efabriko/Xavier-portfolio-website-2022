    <h2>Purpose & Context</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Best360ies was a <b>personal project</b> developed in addition to my <b>full stack
      web development course</b> at CareerFoundry to demonstrate my <b>mastery of
      full-stack JavaScript development</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This project also aims at <b>sharing my passion for discovering diverse
      places worldwide</b> and could serve as a tool for users to <b>enjoy</b> and <b>learn
      about amazing locations</b>.
    </p>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The aim of the project was to have <b>unique</b> and <b>ambitious</b> full-stack project
      I can add to my professional portfolio. This project should also <b>help me
      with bookmarking my favorite 360ies</b>. Indeed while google map is a great
      tool for browsing panoramic photos, <b>I could not find a suitable solution
      to build and share a collection of 360ies I liked</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The problem I wanted to solve is to build the complete server-side and
      client-side for the application from scratch.
    </p>
    <p>The user’s stories of the Project can be found below:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        As a user, I want to <b>be able to browse a collection of 360 panoramic
        photos</b>, access to information on 360 panoramic photos such as country,
        area name, link to the 360 view on google maps so I can <b>discover
        interesting places from around the world</b>.
      </li>
      <li>
        As a User, I want to be able to <b>create a profile</b> so I can <b>save data
        about my favorite 360 panoramic photos and hence create a sort of
        personal collection of 360 panoramic photos</b>.
      </li>
      <li>
        As a User, I want to be <b>able search into the 360 panoramic photos
        collection</b> using the <b>search bar</b> so that I can <b>select only the 360
        panoramic photos related to a specific area</b>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Project structure and key components</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Best360ies Project consists of <b>an API (best360ies-api)</b> as well as <b>a
      Frontend App (best360ies-client-react)</b> built using React library.
    </p>

    <h3>Server-side (best360ies-api)</h3>
    <p>
      I created a <b>RESTful API</b> using <b>Node.js</b> and <b>Express</b>, that interacts with a
      non-relational database <b>(MongoDB)</b>. The API can be accessed via commonly
      used HTTP methods like GET or POST. To retrieve data from and store data
      in the database, CRUD methods are used. The API provides panoramic photos
      (Panos) information in <b>JSON format</b>.
    </p>

    <table style="text-align:center;">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <img
            class=""
            src="img/case_studies/best360ies/image002.png"
            alt="Git icon"
            width="100%"
          />
        </td>
        <td>
          <img
            class=""
            src="img/case_studies/best360ies/image003.png"
            alt="Git icon"
            width="70%"
          />
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><u>JSON Pano Object returned by the API</u></td>
        <td><u>View endpoints and API documentation</u></td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      To test the API, I used <b>Postman</b>. I also included user <b>authentication</b> and
    <b>authorization</b> code in the form of basic HTTP authentication and <b>JWT
      authentication</b>. There is a possibility to add (POST) new Panos which is
      accessible only to a User registered the Admin role. This role is
      accessible through the created JWT Token.
    </p>

    <table style="text-align:center;">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <img
            class=""
            src="img/case_studies/best360ies/image004.png"
            alt="Git icon"
            width="50%"
          />
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><u>Postman view</u></td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Client-side (best360ies-client-react)</h3>
    <p>
      After completing the API, I started to build the interface users would
      need when making requests to, and receiving responses from, the
      server-side. It is a responsive application, developed with
    <b>React</b> and <b>React-Redux</b>. It provides several interface views, including, but
      not limited to, a main view (shows a list of all panoramic photos), single
      panoramic photo view (shows data about a single panoramic photo and allows
      users to add the panoramic photo to their list of favorites), a login
      view, a registration view and a profile view (where users can update their
      user data and list of favorites).
    </p>

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      This was my favorite project because I really <b>enjoy the MERN stack</b> and
      also because of the Project itself that I <b>hope users will love using</b> as
      much as I loved building and using it. Thanks to this side Project I could
      get a great understanding of how to build an API and interface it with the
      Client side. I could also get more confidence using React and in
      particular how States and Props are working along with Redux.

    <p>
      Thanks to the development of previous web applications based on the MERN
      stack, I could develop an MVP version of the full Project (back and front)
      within <b>3 weeks</b>.

    <h2>Further developments</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      In addition to the mentioned earlier development, I have initiated the following next steps of the development of this App:
      <ul>

        <li>
          The implementation of a <b>rating system</b> that allows registered users to rate the panoramic photos they like. The average rating will then be displayed on the panoramic photo
        </li>
        <li>An <b>Admin version of the Client side</b> of the project that gives the Admin the possibility to <b>add a new panoramic photo entry</b> into the database along with associated data such as the 360 static image url, the country where the 360 was taken etc... <b>automatically</b> using JavaScript code as well as some <b>third party API</b> to implement the necessary <b>reverse geocoding functionality</b>.</li>
      </ul>
